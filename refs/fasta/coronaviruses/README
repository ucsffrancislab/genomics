Ran RepeatMasker on them. Still many spikes of alignment.

Masking regions that align to human.


Created hg38-noEBV that does NOT include EBV



Still no RepeatMasker on the cluster. Downloading them to my laptop. Then...

Very little to mask.

Also tried "slow" option with no difference.


./mask.bash > mask.out 2>&1 &


Almost no homology to human. Think only 1 read aligned.
