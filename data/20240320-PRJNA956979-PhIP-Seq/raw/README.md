Bulk RNA sequencing of CDHR5 positive subjects related to a large screen of patients with ILD for autoreactive peptides.



PhIP-Seq uncovers novel autoantibodies and unique endotypes in interstitial lung disease



Only 5 paired end fastq samples.



Because so small, may be worth looking at.




This paper seems to use this data

The bulk RNA sequencing for Figure 3 has been uploaded to the NIH Sequence Read Archive (PRJNA956979).
The PhIP-Seq data itself will be made available through public access keys from the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub that can be requested from the DeRisi lab.
This data will be available to all public requests at the time of manuscript acceptance and can be made available for reviewers as needed in the interim.

This data is just RNA seq
