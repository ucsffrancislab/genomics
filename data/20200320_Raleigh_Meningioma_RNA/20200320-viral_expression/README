Blind RNA viral analysis



kallisto? can't really followup with sleuth without the metadata

diamond doesn't align paired. Not paired data.





hervQuant
RNA-Seq Data
STAR: Simultaneous alignment to hERV and hg19 transcriptome
Total SAM 
Filter: Remove hg19 aligned reads
hERV only SAM 
Salmon: Quantification of hERV expression, normalized to total read count per sample
Expression Matrix
DESeq2 ??? 



STAR to combination of viral and hg38 ?
STAR to just viral?
