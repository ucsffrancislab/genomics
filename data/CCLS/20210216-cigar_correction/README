It seems that the sentieon data contains cigar strings that anger bcftools.

Some are 97I37S, 73I75S, 71I79S, 69I81S, 68I82S and 150I

I am simply going to replace the CIGAR strings with * and hope that this works.

Should change flag as well to quiet warning that follows later.

done



Turns out that this was an error in bcftools 1.11
Use bcftools 1.10.2 or 1.12 when released.
