The subdirs contain collections of bed, bim and bam files created from subsets of the VCFs.

Also, this 1kg_all_chroms_pruned_mds.mds was created by Amelia.

This seems to be specific to her subset so I probably should learn how to create.


--keep accepts a space/tab-delimited text file with family IDs in the first column and within-family IDs in the second column, and removes all unlisted samples from the current analysis. --remove does the same for all listed samples.


#
#	1=male, 2=female, 0=unknown
#
#	awk -F"\t" -vOFS="\t" '($6=="EUR"){s=($3=="male")?1:2;print $2,$1,s}' /francislab/data1/raw/1000genomes/metadata.tsv > EUR_IDS.txt

These files are all "FID,IID,Gender"

awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}(NR>1){ s=($3=="male")?1:2; print $2,$1,s >> "old_ids/"$6"_ids.txt" }' /francislab/data1/raw/1000genomes/metadata.tsv

awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}(NR>1){ s=($3=="male")?1:2; print $2,$1,s >> "old_ids/"$6"_"$4"_ids.txt" }' /francislab/data1/raw/1000genomes/metadata.tsv


#	Use sample id as family id

awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}(NR>1){ s=($3=="male")?1:2; print $1,$1,s >> $6"_ids.txt" }' /francislab/data1/raw/1000genomes/metadata.tsv

awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}(NR>1){ s=($3=="male")?1:2; print $1,$1,s >> $6"_"$4"_ids.txt" }' /francislab/data1/raw/1000genomes/metadata.tsv




Despite the definition of --keep, the family ids / within-family ids are odd.
As in the 1kg spreadsheet, AMR results in none used in the bed file creation.

Recreating with sample id in both columns
