This is a subset of SNPs from Linda Kachuri's UK Biobank study.

zcat UKB_GWAS_MAF01_INFO30.list.gz | awk -vOFS="\t" '(!/^#/){print $1,$2,$2,$3}' > extract_range.txt


--extract MUST be unzipped. 

Can use names, but not all of the names were in my VCF files, so using positions.
Same position for start and end.


Need to redo due to misundertanding of metadata used by plink
