Running chimera on 6 references just taking too long.

Deving read selector for 1 reference, then run chimera with the output as source.


Need to compare the unpaired alignments from the raw data
to the selected alignments from this selection.





As you can see the sample name, N means normal, E and NE mean enhancing and non-enhancing tumor, respectively. 


Could you please take the new WGS data and integrate it in to the HERV/SVA analysis? The priority is to look at the normal samples with the TCGA. These are all GBM so lets call them the GPMP-GBM



The data are stored on C4 cluster, path: /diazlab/data1/GPMP2/EGA, which includes WGS and RNA-seq data folder, see below
cohort1_RNA_seq
cohort1_WGS
cohort2_RNA_seq
