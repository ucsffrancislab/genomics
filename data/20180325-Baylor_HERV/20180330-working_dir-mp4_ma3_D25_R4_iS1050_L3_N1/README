Trying harder to locate HERV insertions by modifying bowtie params


	-D <int>           give up extending after <int> failed extends in a row (15)
	-R <int>           for reads w/ repetitive seeds, try <int> sets of seeds (2)
	-N <int>           max # mismatches in seed alignment; can be 0 or 1 (0)
	-L <int>           length of seed substrings; must be >3, <32 (22)
	-i <func>          interval between seed substrings w/r/t read len (S,1,1.15)
	--ma <int>         match bonus (0 for --end-to-end, 2 for --local) 
	--mp <int>         max penalty for mismatch; lower qual = lower penalty (6)


	--local --mp 4 --ma 3 -D 25 -R 4 -i S,1,0.50 -L 3 -N 1

	S,1,0.50 = f(x) = 1 + 0.50 * x^0.5
		read length = 75
		square root = 8.66
		... = 5.33

	

Better by about 8 fold. But need to do better.


Next time ...

	Lower -D to 15
	Up --ma to 4
	Up  -R to 5
	Try -i S,1,0 ( this may take a while)
