I think that this is RNA



Jan 30, 2018

OK First stab at a mexico plan... let me know wha you think. 



1- Upload raw data to amazon

2- Create .bam file while filtering to hg38

3- Download BAM files and remove from Amazon 

4- BALSTn for non human

5- Diamond protein homology for reads with bad BLASTn hits


6- Chop out ERG section of BAM files (Maybe done locally?)

Please, It is possible that you open an account in Basespace (https://basespace.illumina.com/home/index) , it is very easy to transfer the data. Just need the email that you used to open the account.





I just transfer the project MEX_LEUK_2018.

This project contains 20 of the 30 samples. I highlight them in yellow in the list

The samples 99 and 99_2 are the same

Additionally, there are 2 samples made with mouse germ cell RNA used for another project but I believe that they could be used as a negative control for human virus. If it is not possible, please do not consider them

The other 10 samples will be transferred in a few days
