We provide raw sequence read data from Phage-Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) experiments using serum samples obtained from 798 Qatari nationals or long-term residents who had previously participated in the Qatar Genome Programme (QGP). This submission has 10 samples (i.e. sample Id 1 to 10). With one technical repeat for each sample, total number of entries in this submission is 20 (= 10x2). The rest 788 samples (Sample ID 11 to 798) can be found with SRA submission ID PRJNA688708.

This submission has 788 samples, i.e. sample Id 11 to 798. Each sample has been submitted with a technical repeat. Therefore, total number of entries in this submission is 1576 (=788*2). The first 10 samples (i.e. Sample ID 1 to 10) can be found with SRA submission ID PRJNA685111.
