Getting data used in ENCODE DREAM competition used by Catchitt


Data
We use the following types of input data sets as provided by the challenge organizers (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn6131484/wiki/402033):

The raw sequence of the human genome (hg19) and gene annotations according to the gencode v19 annotation (http://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/19.html) [42]

Cell type-specific DNase-seq "fold-enrichment coverage" tracks, which represent DNase-seq signal relative to a pseudo control, smoothed in a 150-bp window

Cell type-specific DNase-seq peak files in "conservative" (IDR threshold of 10% in pseudo replicates) and "relaxed" (no IDR threshold) flavors

Cell type-specific TPM values from RNA-seq experiments in two bio-replicates for all gencode v19 genes as estimated by RSEM [43]

Cell type-specific and TF-specific ChIP-seq peak files in "conservative" (IDR threshold of 10% in pseudo replicates) and "relaxed" (no IDR threshold) flavors

Cell type-specific and TF-specific label files classifying genome-wide 200-bp regions every 50 bp into B = "bound," A = "ambiguous," and U = "unbound" according to the respective conservative and relaxed ChIP-seq peak files; an overview of the combinations of TF and cell type in the training data, the leaderboard data, and the test data used for evaluation in the final challenge round is given in Additional file 1: Figure S1

In addition, we download sequence motifs represented as PWMs from the following collections:

TF-specific motifs from the databases HOCOMOCO [44] and DBcorrDB [45]

Motifs related to epigenetic markers from the epigram pipeline [46]



Details about the motifs considered are given in the "Features" section and Additional file 1: Text S2.

For predicting cell type-specific binding of TFs in additional cell types beyond those considered in the challenge, we download DNase-seq data (FastQ format) from the ENCODE project (http://www.encodeproject.org). Specifically, we select all DNase-seq experiments that (i) are flagged as "released," (ii) have FastQ files available, (iii) are not from immortalized cell lines, (iv) have no entry in one of the "Audit error" categories, and (v) are not in the "insufficient replicate concordance" category of "Audit not compliant." A list of the corresponding experiments is obtained from the ENCODE project, and experiments are filtered for the existence of at least two replicates, yielding 23 experiments in total. One of these experiments had to be excluded later, because a different DNase protocol with much shorter reads had been used. For the remaining 22 experiments (Additional file 1: Table S5), all FastQ files are downloaded from ENCODE and processed using ATAC-Seq/DNase-Seq Pipeline (https://github.com/kundajelab/atac_dnase_pipelines, latest git commit: c1d07d38a02af2f0319a69707eee047ab6112ecc (Tue Mar 21 20:31:25 2017)). The data sets are analyzed using the following parameters: -species hg19 -type dnase-seq -subsample 50M -se. For further analyses, the relaxed (./out/peak/idr/pseudo_reps/rep1/*.filt.narrowPeak.gz) and conservative peaks (./out/peak/macs2/overlap/*pval0.1*.filt.narrowPeak.gz) as well as the DNase coverage (./out/signal/macs2/rep1/*.fc.signal.bigwig) are used.

In addition, we download ChIP-seq peak files (Additional file 1: Table S6) matching these cell types and one of the TFs considered. Based on the "relaxed" (i.e., "optimal idr thresholded peaks") and "conservative" (i.e., "conservative idr thresholded peaks") peak files, we derive labels for 200-bp windows every 50 bp as proposed for the challenge. Specifically, we label each 200-bp region overlapping a conservative peak by at least 100 bp as "bound." Of the remaining regions, all regions that overlap a relaxed peak by at least 1 bp are labeled "ambiguous," while all other regions are labeled "unbound." For a subset of TFs, no conservative peaks are available due to the lack of replicates. In such cases, we also use the relaxed peaks to assign "bound" labels.

ENCSR657DFR appears to be archived and superseded by ENCSR450PWF
Neither have downloadable, replicated fastq data.
Not sure why its in the list.

I can't find a successful set of options to have these 22 experiments be selected.
