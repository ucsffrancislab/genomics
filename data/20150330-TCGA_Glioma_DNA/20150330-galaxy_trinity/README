These data sets are HUGE.

Needed to fastx_collapse or use --normalize_reads option for Trinity
to assemble.  I am unsure of the repercussions of using this option.
Nevertheless, without it we had nothing.

Only worked for the smallest data set.

Now trying --min_kmer_cov 2 option.

Collapsing is bad as you lose laning.

Using the NCGAS Galaxy Portal at IU for the assembly.

I has worked on all data sets so far, including the largest set!

Normalization is also used on the NCGAS Galaxy Portal at IU
