##	Approved users of these data should include the following acknowledgement in all public presentations and publications of research conducted using these data.

The genome sequence described/used in this research was derived from a HeLa cell line. Henrietta Lacks, and the HeLa cell line that was established from her tumor cells without her knowledge or consent in 1951, have made significant contributions to scientific progress and advances in human health. We are grateful to Henrietta Lacks, now deceased, and to her surviving family members for their contributions to biomedical research. This study was reviewed by the NIH HeLa Genome Data Access Working Group. The genomic datasets used for analysis described in this manuscript were obtained from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) through dbGaP accession number phs000640.v1.p1.

##	Acknowledgement Statement: Please cite/reference the use of dbGaP data by including the dbGaP accession phs000640.v10.p1. Additionally, use the following statement to acknowledge the submitter(s) of this study:
