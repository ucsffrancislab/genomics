##	Descriptive Title of Project

Please note that coordinated requests by collaborating institutions should each use the same title.





##	Research Use Statement

A RUS is a brief description of the applicant's proposed use of dbGaP dataset(s). The RUS will be reviewed by all NIH Institutes and Centers responsible for data covered by this Data Access Request. Please note that if access is approved, you agree that the RUS, along with your name and institution, will be included on the dbGap website to describe your research project to the public.

Please make it clear whether you plan to combine requested datasets with other datasets outside of dbGaP, and, if so, whether you plan to analyze these datasets independently or together. If you do plan to combine datasets in any way, please describe your plan and also please discuss whether it creates any additional risks to participants. If you are focusing on outcomes or hypotheseses that were not the focus of the primary study (or studies), please describe the outcomes you propose to examine.

Investigators do not need to submit a new project request unless the dataset will be used for research outside of the scope of the approved Research Use Statement.

Please enter your RUS in the are below. The RUS should be one or two paragraphs in length and include research objectives, the study design, and an analysisi plan (including phenotypic characteristics that will be tested for association with genetic variants). If you are requesting multiple datasets, please describe how you will use them. Examples of RUS can be found at GDS website. Please limit your RUS to 4500 characters.





##	Non-technical summary

Please enter below a non-technical summary of your RUS suitable for understanding by the general public (written at a high school reading level or below). Please limit your non-technical summary to 1300 characters.



Our lab analyzes a variety of data sets including 1000 Genomes, TCGA, TARGET and SGDP for variations, mutations, retro elements, viruses and other non-human genetic content for any correlation or impact on cancer survival. Differences in novel insertion points of known retro elements and integrated non-human seuqences 




We should probably include some lines about looking at mutations, retrolements, and epigenetic because, hey, the data is there and you never know!!
