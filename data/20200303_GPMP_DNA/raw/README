Here is the path to these data, please see below. Currently, the RNA-Seq data for batch 1 and batch 2 are already on the cluster, and the WGS data will take a while.

This is GBM DNA and RNA data that we can play with.

Initially from Diaz Lab.



N is normal samples (blood samples). Just for WGS, not available for rna-seq
NE means non-enhancing.
E means enhancing.

Brain tissue.
Case numbers are the prefixed with "SF" of each file name. eg  SF12210

All this is whole genome sequencing data: so DNA. I will upload the bulk RNA now. 



 
rsync -avz --progress /data/fcatalan/WGS_data/ ./WGS_data/


mkdir fastq

for f in WGS_data/batch1/*.fq.gz; do b=$( basename $f .fq.gz ); b=${b%%_val_?}; b=${b%%_001}; b=${b/_R/_L000_R}; echo $b $f; ln -s ../$f fastq/$b.fastq.gz; done

for f in WGS_data/batch2/*/*.fastq.gz; do b=$( basename $f _001.fastq.gz ); b=${b#P???}; b=${b/N_/-N_}; echo $b $f; ln -s ../$f fastq/$b.fastq.gz; done









DIR=/francislab/data1/raw/20200303_GPMP_DNA
for f in ${DIR}/fastq/*fastq.gz ; do
echo read_length_hist.bash $f
done | qsub -N 20200303raw -l nodes=1:ppn=8 -l vmem=16gb \
-j oe -o ${DIR}/read_length_hist.bash.out 


Then sum up hist data counts. DON'T RE-READ RAW FILES

DIR=/francislab/data1/raw/20200303_GPMP_DNA/fastq
zcat ${DIR}/*_R?.fastq.gz.length_hist.csv.gz | awk '{c[$2]+=$1}END{for(n in c){print c[n],n}}' | sort -k2n | gzip > ${DIR}/all_R.length_hist.csv.gz
