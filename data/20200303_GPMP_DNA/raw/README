Here is the path to these data, please see below. Currently, the RNA-Seq data for batch 1 and batch 2 are already on the cluster, and the WGS data will take a while.

This is GBM DNA and RNA data that we can play with.

Initially from Diaz Lab.



N is normal samples (blood samples). Just for WGS, not available for rna-seq
NE means non-enhancing.
E means enhancing.

Brain tissue.
Case numbers are the prefixed with "SF" of each file name. eg  SF12210

All this is whole genome sequencing data: so DNA. I will upload the bulk RNA now.
