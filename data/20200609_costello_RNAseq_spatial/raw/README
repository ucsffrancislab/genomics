Names are a little inconsistent so moved all to original/

I will cleanup and link in fastq/


mkdir fastq
for f in original/*.fastq.gz ; do
l=$( basename $f _001.fastq.gz )
l=${l/#?p/p}
l=${l/_SF/SF}
l=${l/_S*_R/_R}
l=${l^^}
v=${l%_R*}
v=${v#*V}
v=$( echo ${v} | awk '{if($0~/P/)$0=0;printf("%02d",$0)}' )
r=${l#*_R}
s=${l%_R*}
s=${s%V*}
#echo $s 
#c=$( grep $s sample_codes.txt | awk '{print $2}' )
#echo $c s:$s v:$v r:$r
p=${l%S*}
p=${p#P}
echo p:$p s:$s v:$v r:$r
ln -s ../$f fastq/${p}v${v}_R${r}.fastq.gz
done 

#| sort | uniq > sample_codes.txt 






Note that there is a transposition of numbers ....

Hi Chibo,

Hope you are having a great time – we miss you!

Just for quality control purposes (in case helpful to trace back where the error might have come from + correct in your lab notebook), I wanted to let you know that the SF number used for P413 in the sample IDs for Batch19 submission was incorrect. The number used was 11137, but the actual SF# should be 11173.

I am going to make sure we switch back to the correct SF for all downstream processing, so it won’t have an impact on anything else.

Thanks!

Stephanie






11137 was changed to 11173 after linking.
