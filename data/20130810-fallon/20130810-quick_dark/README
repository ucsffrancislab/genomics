2013 (summer) ....


Processing of all samples with either dark.rb or quick_dark.sh

Basically, both lanes were combined and each read separately aligned to many dbs.

Those that didn't align to any of the dbs were saved in trinity_input_single.fasta.

Those reads in trinity_input_single.fasta were reunited with their mate if it
also did not align to any of the dbs and were saved in trinity_input_paired_[12].fasta.
