# First, need to install the proper packages in R
# In R, run these commands


if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("edgeR")
BiocManager::install("EDASeq")
install.packages('ggplot2')
install.packages'RColorBrewer')
install.packages('pheatmap')
install.packages('gridExtra')


# The script EdgeR_Template.R can be run on the command line by providing 10 command line parameters, in the following order
1. PATH/TO/REDISCOVER/DATA
2. PATH/TO/COVARIATE/FILE/covfile.txt ( this needs to be space or tab delimited entries)
3. PATH/TO/OUTPUT/DIR
4. Column name in cov file that has the sample ID's that exactly match those in REdiscover (in my covariate files it is RE_names)
5. Column name in the cov file that has the group membership labels. 
6. Column names for the adjustment covariates, e.g. c("Age","sex","race"). If no covariates, put NA
7. Datatypes of the adjustment covariates e.g. c(numeric, factor, factor). If no covariates, put NA
8. Number (1-10) indicating which REdiscoverTE file to analyze ( see below for which numbers represent what), I typically analyze #6 first 
9. Alpha threshold, e.g. 0.01 
10. LogFC threshold, start with 0.25 and increase to reduce the amount of plots which are output 
11. The date, and any other prefix you want on the output, eg. 20210407 or 20210407_Stanford etc. 

# Example 
Rscript ./EdgeR_Template.R gguerra/rediscover gguerra/covs/mycovfile.txt gguerra/rediscover/results RE_names groups c("Age","sex","race") c(numeric,factor,factor) 6 0.01 0.25 20210407

# Options for input argument 8
1. GENE
2. RE_intron
3. RE_exon
4. RE_intergenic
5. RE_all
6. RE_all_repFamily
7. RE_all_repClass
8. RE_intron_repFamily
9. RE_exon_repFamily
10. RE_intergenic_repFamily

## THINGS TO NOTE
# I don't know how to pipe this script to an Rmarkdown file on the command line yet, I usually do it natively within R. 

# The only thing currently set to output is a high res version of the heatmap at the end of the script. 

# No other plots will save unless the script is piped to an Rmarkdown file. 

# I have never run this script using the command line arguemnts at all, hopefully nothing breaks, the script has examples of input commented out in it.
