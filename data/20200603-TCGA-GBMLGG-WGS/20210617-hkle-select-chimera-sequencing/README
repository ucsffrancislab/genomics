Need to compare the unpaired alignments from the raw data
to the selected alignments from this selection.

* running by sequencing and not concatenated samples.
* limit to just 01 and 10?
* limit to just 101 and 151 bp sequencings?
* using newer bowtie2 so no need for the extreme custom scoring?
* also using paired data so no need for custom scoring
