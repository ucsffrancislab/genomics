Un-recalibrate TCGA's recalibration? NO

Remove DUPs as well? YES



I don't think that this is the way to go.
I think that I should explicitly name the output files using

F=<stdout>: output file for the first mates of pairs if collation is active.

F2=<stdout>: output file for the second mates of pairs if collation is active.

S=<stdout>: output file for single end reads if collation is active.

O=<stdout>: output file for unmatched (orphan) first mates if collation is active.

O2=<stdout>: output file for unmatched (orphan) second mates if collation is active.
