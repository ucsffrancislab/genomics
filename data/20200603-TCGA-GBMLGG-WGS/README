Using manifest files are just too "mysterious". No idea what is downloading.
All the hash filenames are just so undesireable.
Unclear why the previous run crashed.
Unclear what has been happening overnight since no new files exist.
Still only 119 bam files and expecting 279.




Trying to speed things up
